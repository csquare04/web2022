<span>What's up everyone thanks foir checking out my page! Here
  i will talk about  how i started my fitness journey
  and where i am now! I began lifting the summer before my
  freshman year of highschool to prepare for my first highschool
  football season. Over the next the three years the only gym
  time i saw was really with the team in our facilities which
  really was your basic team lift.
  However, once my senior year ended i wanted to remain active
  so i started going to planet fitness. i then left for college and ever since
  i have been lifting seriously for five to six days a week!
  Recently (3/6/2022) i have competed in my first powerlifting
  competiiton where i took first in my weight class and division
  and three state records! i plan to compete in a bodybuilding
  show as well so im excited for that!
  while im not in the gym you can find me with friens, family, and the
  the various christian ministires im part of. I hope you find
  my page helpful and im excited to see where you go!</span>
